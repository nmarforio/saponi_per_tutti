This is a Next.JS project that I decide to create to help my sister small business of homemade soaps in Switzerland.
The all website is in italian cause my family is from Ticino, the italian part of Switzerland.

I'm using Javascritp and MongoDb as a database and I still working on it because I want to deliver a complite Website that can be easy to understand for client and the Admins.
Currently I am developing the payment method with Stripe, I want to adjust the design and add some other functionality as soon as possible.

If you are intrested take a look and leave a comment if you like i woudl be glad.

Have a good one 
Nicole
